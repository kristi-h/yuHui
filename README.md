# YuHui: A game for practicing Chinese character recognition

# Overview

While learning Chinese, I noticed I was spending a great deal of time writing and recalling Chinese characters. There were just too many of them, and it was too time consuming to write them all out by hand each time. My goal was to get a proficient level of character recognition rather than writing everything out by heart, so I wanted to find a way to practice that. 

I wanted to make a game that was equally engaging, fun and educational. The scrambled grid of characters gives a similar feeling of word puzzles and matching games, which most of us are familiar with, so it is intuitive to get started and play. 

# Features

There are separate levels for each of the HSK levels and each vocabulary list contains ~600 words. Once you choose the HSK level, the game will automatically create **clusters** for that vocabulary list. Each **cluster** is a sub-stack deck of words. The reason for creating these **clusters** was so that each deck would be a manageable size and the user can repeat what they just practiced in condensed batches.
